Over the last 2-3 years I have been exploring Haxe and OpenFL personally but now I am on cloud nine because I can officially use Haxe at work.

I should thank my company [Gamesys](http://www.gamesyscorporate.com) for giving the opportunity to showcase the power of Haxe and how it can benefit the company and the developers.

I managed to convince the team and got them excited as well, so looking forward to develop cool stuff using Haxe :)
