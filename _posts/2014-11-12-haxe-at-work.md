title: Haxe at work?
---

Over the last 2-3 years I have been exploring Haxe and OpenFL personally but now I am really happy and excited to be able to officially code in Haxe at work.

I should thank my company [http://www.gamesyscorporate.com](Gamesys) for giving the opportunity to showcase what Haxe can do.

I managed to convince the team and got them excited as well, so exciting times ahead :)
