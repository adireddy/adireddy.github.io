With the new “[Custom platform support](http://www.adobe.com/uk/products/flash/features.html)” in Flash Professional CC, Haxe/OpenFL will soon be available in Flash IDE which is a great news for Haxe developers.

Look at Joshua Granick's [quick demo](http://max.adobe.com/sessions/max-online/#/video/567) showing how it works.

You can skip to Haxe/OpenFL demo which starts at around 25:00.
