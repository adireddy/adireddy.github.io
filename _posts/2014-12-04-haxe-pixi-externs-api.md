title: Haxe pixi.js externs API (using chxdoc)
---

I was playing with documentation generator library [chxdoc](https://github.com/ibilon/chxdoc) this week and amazingly it covered all the basics I needed for generating API documentation.

With a bit of template customization, I have generated API documentation for my [pixi.js haxe externs](http://adireddy.github.io/docs/haxe-pixi/) and it looked pretty good.

Even though most of the contents of this API are same as [pixi.js](http://www.goodboydigital.com/pixijs/docs/) API, I think it is a good reference to check the haxe equivalent data types of variables, function parameters and return types. You can also use this to quickly check if any of the functionality is missing in the extern classes.

I will explain more on how to use chxdoc library in my next post.
