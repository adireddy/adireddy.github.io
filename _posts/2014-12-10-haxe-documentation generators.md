A quick intro to a couple of documentation generators I have tried recently [chxdoc](https://github.com/ibilon/chxdoc) and [yuidoc](http://yui.github.io/yuidoc/).

Note that yuidoc is Javascript Documentation Tool which also works with Haxe.

### chxdoc ###
Make sure you have chxdoc installed.

`haxelib install chxdoc`

chxdoc generates Java like documentation based on the XML output generated by haxe compiler using `xml` compiler parameter as shown below.

`haxe -xml docs.xml --macro include('pixi')`

By default, compiler generates the xml documentation for haxe package and you can use macros to include custom packages like `pixi` in the above sample.

When you have the xml documentation ready you can run [chxdoc](https://github.com/ibilon/chxdoc) command and the following is the one I used to generate [pixi.js haxe externs documentation](http://adireddy.github.io/docs/haxe-pixi/).

`haxelib run chxdoc -o output_folder -f docs.xml --deny=haxe.*,/ --title='Externs of pixi.js for Haxe' --subtitle='<a href='http://adireddy.github.io/haxe-pixi' target='_blank'>haxe-pixi</a>'`

* output_folder - The folder path where you want the documentation to be generated
* --deny - You can specify the `,` separated list of all the packages you want to exclude from the documentation (haxe package and `/` denotes root classes in the above sample).

I hope all the other options are self explanatory.
 
You can also use `--developer=true` to generate developer documentation with all the private data documented.

### YUIDoc ###

YUIDoc is much more simpler to use and I only tried it because [pixi.js](http://www.goodboydigital.com/pixijs/docs/) is using it for their documentation.

It's is Node.js application and you should install it using node package manager `npm -g install yuidocjs`

I have created `yuidoc.json` file to store the configuration.

```haxe
{
     "name": "haxe-pixi",
     "description": "Haxe Pixi Externs",
     "version": "2.1.9",
     "url": "https://github.com/adireddy/haxe-pixi",
     "options": {
         "linkNatives": "true",
         "attributesEmit": "true",
         "selleck": "true",
         "ignorePaths": [ "demos" ],
         "paths": "*/hx",
         "outdir": "yui"
     }
 }
```

Finally run the following command to generate the documentation.

`yuidoc -e .hx .`

Here is the link to [haxe pixi externs](http://adireddy.github.io/docs/haxe-pixi/yui/) YUIDoc documentation.
