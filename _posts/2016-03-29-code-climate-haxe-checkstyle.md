I am happy to announce the partnership with Code Climate to bring static analysis via Haxe Checkstyle to all Haxe users.

Now you can to analyze Haxe projects on [codeclimate.com](http://codeclimate.com), as well as run custom static analysis for Haxe on your command line with their new CLI tool.

If you are not familiar with Code Climate, it's a static analysis tool for monitoring the health of your code.
It supports a whole host of languages and frameworks -- and it's all open source!

It lets you configure your analysis via a .codeclimate.yml file in the root of your repository.
