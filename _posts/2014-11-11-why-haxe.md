Haxe is simple, lightweight, easy to learn, yet a very powerful strictly typed language with lightning fast compiler.

If your main target is JavaScript like me, Haxe can be a better coding option than coding in JavaScript directly. Haxe will transpile your code to clean and efficient JavaScript.

There are a lot of useful libraries readily available at [lib.haxe.org](http://lib.haxe.org).

I have created haxe externs for some popular JavaScript libraries and there are few libraries available from others listed below together.
